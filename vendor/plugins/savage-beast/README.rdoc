= Savage Beast

Savage Beast is a Rails Message forum plugin based on the popular Beast plugin.
The Savage Beast plugin has been installed in hundreds of Rails sites, partially
because it's the only viable choice for a message forum plugin, but also because
it incorporates a lot of features that would be a time-consuming headache for you
to implement yourself.

This version of Savage Beast has been tested working in Rails 2.3.
